I used the community version of pycharm ide to run the 'main' python script.
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

The python script generates a csv file with a playlist's song data.

The python script needs a developer information. This is in the script:
cid='d72a125df9364ce6b1f9ab9d3a2a86f0'
secret='48ea891fe3ca4a1f86b8bf3978bb5681'

I used this playlist:
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbNG2KDcFcKOF?si=1333723a6eff4b7f

I think we can use the data from any publically available playlist.
